# MetaCrafters ATM - Smart Contract Management

This project is a simple Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) example utilizing React and Ethereum smart contracts. It allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with a deployed smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling functions like depositing and withdrawing ETH.

## Description

The MetaCrafters ATM application is a demonstration of how to integrate Ethereum smart contracts with a React frontend. Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to the application and perform basic banking operations like depositing and withdrawing ETH using smart contract functions.
